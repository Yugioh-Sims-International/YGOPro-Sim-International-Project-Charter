# YGOPro-Sim-International-Project-Charter
The core of Ygopro International comes from the desire tO improve the user experience and give the enduser what they want.

Actual Rules

Everyone else is equal.

Do no evil

If there is a problem with the software, file a bug.

Do not take work you can not complete in a timely manner, or show progress of completing.

We are making software for end-users.

Don't make things that are locked to one operating system, bad UI, require lots of dependencies or require non-default configuration.

Setup should be as few steps as possible.

ALWAYS DOCUMENT YOUR WORK NO EXCEPTIONS.
